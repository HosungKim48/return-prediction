# Complexity in Return Predictions for Asset Management
### Using Dense Neural Networks and the Keras API

> *"Where complexity meets capital — forecasting returns to navigate financial market dynamics."*

---

## Project Overview
This project explores the application of **Deep Learning** to one of the most challenging problems in finance: **predicting asset returns**. Using a classic academic dataset [Goyal and Welch (2008)](https://sites.google.com/view/amit-goyal-webpage/home), this analysis moves beyond traditional linear factor models to build a **Dense Neural Network (DNN)** with Keras capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships in financial data.

The goal is not just to build a model, but to investigate the role of **model complexity** itself, motivated by modern ML theories like **"Double Descent"** and the **"Virtue of Complexity."** This project serves as a foundation for building quantitative strategies in active asset management.

## Takeaways

**Key highlights:**
- Connected a core financial task (**return prediction**) to the business of **Asset Management** (AUM growth, risk management).
- Applied **Dense Neural Networks (MLPs)** to a high-noise, low-signal financial time-series problem.
- Implemented and trained a deep learning model from scratch using the **TensorFlow/Keras Sequential API**.
- Explored the theoretical trade-offs between model complexity, **Bias vs. Variance**, and out-of-sample performance ($R^2_{OOS}$).

> This work bridges the gap between traditional quantitative finance and modern deep learning, demonstrating a practical workflow for non-linear financial modeling.

## Concepts Explored
- **Financial Factor Models:** The linear regression baseline ($r = \alpha + \beta F + \epsilon$).
- **Deep Learning Theory:** DNNs as universal function approximators for non-linear regression.
- **Keras Sequential API:** Building models layer-by-layer (`Input`, `Normalization`, `Dense`).
- **Network Architecture:** Hidden layers, units, and `ReLU` vs. `linear` activation functions.
- **Model Compilation & Training:** `Adam` optimizer, `MSE` loss, and the `.fit()` training loop.
- **Prediction Theory:** Bias-Variance Tradeoff, Out-of-Sample $R^2$ ($R^2_{OOS}$), and the "Double Descent" phenomenon.

## Conceptual Summary & Business Impact

This project connects deep learning theory to the strategic decisions of **asset managers**.

In traditional finance, **Linear Factor Models** are used to explain returns. This project frames that approach as a simple single-layer perceptron. However, market dynamics are rarely linear. The relationship between inflation, interest rates, and equity returns can change dramatically based on the economic regime.

A **Dense Neural Network (DNN)**, built with Keras, can capture these **complex, non-linear interactions**. By stacking layers, the model learns hierarchical representations of the features, allowing it to model dependencies that a linear model would miss.

This project specifically highlights the **"Virtue of Complexity."** While traditional statistics prizes simple models to avoid overfitting (the "Bias-Variance Tradeoff"), modern theory shows that *highly complex* models (like DNNs) can often achieve *better* out-of-sample performance by finding a new regime of "benign overfitting."

**In business terms, this advanced modeling supports:**
- **Improved Risk Management:** By better understanding non-linear drivers of risk and return.
- **Enhanced Portfolio Construction:** Informing tactical asset allocation (TAA) decisions.
- **Quantitative Strategy Development:** Serving as the predictive engine for automated trading or factor-investing strategies.
- **Growing AUM:** Delivering a performance edge is the primary driver for attracting and retaining client assets.

> Ultimately, this approach provides a quantitative foundation for building robust, next-generation investment products that can adapt to evolving market structures.

## Technical Summary

**Pipeline**
1.  **Data Loading & Preparation:** Loaded the Goyal & Welch (2008) monthly predictor dataset using Pandas.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Calculated derived variables (e.g., `dp`, `ep`, `tms`, `dfy`) as described in the source paper.
3.  **Data Splitting:** Partitioned the data into time-series-aware **training (90%)** and **testing (10%)** sets.
4.  **Model Architecture:** Built a **DNN** using the **Keras Sequential API** with an `Input` layer, a `Normalization` layer, three hidden `Dense` layers (10 units each, `ReLU` activation), and a final `Dense` output layer (1 unit, `linear` activation).
5.  **Model Compilation:** Compiled the model using the `Adam` optimizer and `mean_squared_error` (`mse`) as the loss function.
6.  **Model Training:** Trained the network for 150 epochs, monitoring both training and validation loss (`validation_split=0.1`).

**Tools**

## Results
- The model successfully trained, with training loss decreasing significantly over 150 epochs.
- The validation loss curve showed a pattern typical of financial data: an initial sharp decrease followed by stabilization and signs of overfitting, highlighting the need for careful tuning and regularization (e.g., Early Stopping, Dropout).
- The out-of-sample $R^2$ was negative, which is **common and expected** for this specific benchmark. As noted in the project, an $R^2_{OOS} < 0$ (underperforming the historical mean) does not preclude the model from generating profitable strategies (e.g., high Sharpe Ratios).
- The final model serves as a strong baseline for further experimentation with architecture, regularization, and feature engineering.

## Business Link
This predictive model is the **analytical engine** for a sophisticated **decision-support tool** for portfolio managers.

By generating forecasts for future market returns, this system directly informs:
- **Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA):** Whether to be overweight or underweight equities versus other asset classes.
- **Risk Budgeting:** Identifying when predicted returns are low and risk (e.g., `svar` feature) is high.
- **Quantitative Product Design:** This model can be the core of a "smart beta" or "quantamental" ETF or mutual fund.

It transforms the asset management process from one based on linear assumptions to one that embraces and models the market's inherent complexity.
